Q. List us any 3 ways which helps us in improving  the accessibility of HTML.

There are several ways to improve the accessibility of HTML documents. Here are three important techniques:

1. Semantic HTML Elements: Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure to your content. Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` convey the intended meaning of the content, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret and present the information to users. Semantic markup also benefits all users by enhancing the overall readability and understanding of the content.

   Example:

   <header>
       <h1>Website Title</h1>
   </header>
   <nav>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
   </nav>
   <main>
       <article>
           <h2>Article Title</h2>
           <p>Article content goes here.</p>
       </article>
   </main>
   <footer>
       <p>&copy; 2023 Website Name. All rights reserved.</p>
   </footer>

2. Descriptive Text for Images: Provide descriptive alternative text for images (`alt` attribute) to convey the content and function of the images to users who cannot see them. Meaningful alternative text is essential for users with visual impairments, as screen readers read aloud this information.

   Example:

   <img src="example.jpg" alt="A woman reading a book in a library">

3. Proper Form Labels and ARIA Roles: Ensure that form elements have descriptive and programmatically associated labels. For complex user interfaces, use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content. ARIA roles provide information to assistive technologies about the role and properties of specific elements on the page.

   Example (with ARIA roles):

   <label for="username">Username:</label>
   <input type="text" id="username" aria-label="Enter your username" aria-required="true">

   <div role="button" aria-label="Open Menu" tabindex="0">
       Menu
   </div>
