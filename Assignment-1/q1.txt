Q. List out features of HTML5?

HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used for creating web pages and web applications, introduced several new features and enhancements. Here's a list of some key features of HTML5:

1. Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>` to provide better structure and meaning to the content.

2. Audio and Video Support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, reducing the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

3. Canvas: HTML5 introduced the `<canvas>` element, which allows dynamic rendering of graphics and images directly within the browser, enabling the creation of interactive games and animations.

4. Offline Web Applications: HTML5 provides features like Application Cache and Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) that enable web applications to work offline and store data locally.

5. Web Workers: HTML5 introduced the concept of web workers, which are background scripts that can run concurrently with the main JavaScript thread, improving the performance and responsiveness of web applications.

6. Geolocation: HTML5 allows websites to access the user's geographical location through the Geolocation API, enabling location-based services and applications.

7. Drag and Drop: HTML5 provides native support for drag-and-drop interactions, making it easier to implement intuitive and interactive user interfaces.

8. Form Enhancements: HTML5 introduced several new input types (`<input type="date">`, `<input type="email">`, etc.) and attributes (such as `required`, `placeholder`, and `pattern`) to enhance form validation and user experience.

9. Improved Accessibility: HTML5 introduced several features and attributes to enhance web accessibility, making it easier for developers to create websites that are usable by people with disabilities.

10. New Doctype: HTML5 introduced a simpler and more straightforward `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the beginning of HTML documents, making it easier to write and understand HTML code.

These features have collectively contributed to a more powerful, interactive, and user-friendly web experience. Keep in mind that this list covers some of the major features, and HTML5 includes many other enhancements and improvements as well.
