Q. What are HTML entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities.

HTML entities are special codes used in HTML documents to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML or characters that are not easily typable with a keyboard. These entities start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. &lt; - Represents the less-than sign (`<`). It is used to display the less-than symbol without interpreting it as the opening of an HTML tag.

2. &gt; - Represents the greater-than sign (`>`). It is used to display the greater-than symbol without interpreting it as the closing of an HTML tag.

3. &amp; - Represents the ampersand (`&`). It is used to display the ampersand symbol without interpreting it as the start of an HTML entity.

4. &quot; - Represents the double quotation mark (`"`). It is used to display double quotes without interpreting them as the start or end of an HTML attribute value.

5. &apos; - Represents the apostrophe or single quotation mark (`'`). Note that this entity is not as widely supported as the others, so it's often safer to use the actual character itself. However, it is included in this list for completeness.

These entities are essential for displaying reserved characters and special symbols correctly in HTML documents.
